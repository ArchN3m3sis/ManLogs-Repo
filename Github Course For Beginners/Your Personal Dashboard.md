Your personal dashboard is the first page you'll see when you sign in on GitHub.

To access your personal dashboard once you're signed in, click the

in the upper-left corner of any page on GitHub.

## [Finding your recent activity](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#finding-your-recent-activity)

In the "Recent activity" section of your news feed, you can quickly find and follow up with recently updated issues and pull requests you're working on. Under "Recent activity", you can preview up to 4 recent updates made in the last two weeks.

Open issues and pull requests appear in the recent activity section when:

- You have opened an issue or pull request.
- Someone has commented on an issue or pull request you opened.
- Your issue or pull request was reopened.
- Your review was requested on a pull request.
- You were assigned to an issue or pull request.
- You referenced an issue or pull request via a commit.
- You commented on an issue or pull request.

## [Finding your top repositories and teams](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#finding-your-top-repositories-and-teams)

- In the global navigation menu, you can access the top repositories and teams you use. To open the menu, select at the top left of any page.

- The list of top repositories is automatically generated, and can include any repository you have interacted with, whether it's owned directly by your account or not. Interactions include making commits and opening or commenting on issues and pull requests. The list of top repositories cannot be edited, but repositories will drop off the list 1 year after you last interacted with them.

- You can also find a list of your recently visited repositories, teams, and projects when you click into the search bar at the top of any page on GitHub.

**Note:** The new feed is currently in public beta and subject to change.

The feed is designed to help you discover relevant content from projects you follow, keep up with your friends and community members, and track recent activity in your communities.

You can use the **Filter** dropdown in the upper right corner to filter the feed to show only the exact event types you'd like to see. For example, you'll see updates when someone you follow:

- Stars a repository.
- Follows another user.
- Creates a public repository.
- Opens an issue or pull request with `help wanted` or `good first issue` label on a repository you're watching.
- Pushes commits to a repository you watch.
- Forks a public repository.
- Publishes a new release.

## [Exploring recommended repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#exploring-recommended-repositories)

In the =="Explore repositories"== section on the right side of your dashboard, you can explore recommended repositories in your communities. Recommendations are based on repositories you've starred or visited, the people you follow, and activity within repositories that you have access to.
